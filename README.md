# Spam-Email-Classifer-MATLAB
Naive bayes theorem is applied assuming  that each word is strongly independent and  doesn't depend on occurrences of other  words. • We find the posterior probability of each  word given to test, based on the previously  known probabilities and prior. • Prior is the chance whether an arbitrary mail  is spam or non-spam, based on how  frequently we receive them.
